# Health Clinic App 👩🏽‍⚕️

The purpose of this project is to help people find clinics nearby that offer services they need, help them with booking appointments with said clinics, know when the practitioners, doctors, nurses are available... more importantly this is to ensure an ease for people when going to clinics so that they dont have to wait in unnecessary lines at clinics not knowing when they have a chance with the doctor, instead i want this to help both the clinics and patients.

I want to document my journey on how i plan on going about building this project, maybe on my blog section on my [portfolio](kevinraleie.vercel.app), still working on it but it will be up soon soon. And also on my [instagram](https://instagram.com/kevinraleie) as well. 

I dont want to obsess too much about the stack because it might change but know that this project is going to be on the GraphQL ecosystem.
